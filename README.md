<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **What type of Structured Query Language did we use for the database schema?**

  - We used PostgreSQL for the database schema. The schema is defined in the schema.sql file.

- **Where are the application features linked for display on the user interface?**

  - The application features are linked and implemented in the main.rb file. The main.rb file serves as the entry point for the console application and allows users to manage collections of the things they own. The console app presents a list of options to perform, allows users to choose an option, and prompts them for any necessary parameters. The user interface also makes use of the data stored in the database and JSON files to display information about the user's collections.
